# Posts API Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the Posts API endpoints and verify that everything is working correctly, including the database triggers.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your server is running on `http://localhost:3100`
2. Ensure your database is connected and the triggers are properly set up
3. Install the test dependencies

## Installation

```bash
# Install test dependencies
npm install

# Or install specific dependencies
npm install axios jest supertest
```

## Running Tests

### 1. Simple Test Script (Recommended)

This is a comprehensive test that checks all endpoints and verifies database triggers:

```bash
npm test
```

Or run directly:

```bash
node test-posts.js
```

### 2. Jest Tests

For more detailed unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:jest
```

Or run directly:

```bash
npx jest posts.test.js
```

## What the Tests Verify

### âœ… Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login
- JWT token validation
- Protected route access
- Unauthorized request handling

### âœ… Post Management
- Creating posts with title and content
- Retrieving all posts
- Getting specific posts with comments
- View count tracking
- Post status updates

### âœ… Comment System
- Adding comments to posts
- Retrieving comments for posts
- Comment ordering (accepted first, then by votes)

### âœ… Voting System
- Upvoting and downvoting posts
- Upvoting and downvoting comments
- Vote toggle functionality (upvote again removes vote)
- Vote count updates via database triggers

### âœ… Answer Acceptance
- Marking comments as accepted answers
- Post owner permission validation
- Updating post `is_answered` and `accepted_answer_id`

### âœ… Database Triggers
- **Vote Count Triggers**: Automatically update `upvotes` and `downvotes` counts
- **Answer Count Triggers**: Automatically update `answer_count` when comments are added/removed
- **View Count**: Manually incremented when posts are viewed

### âœ… Error Handling
- Missing authentication
- Invalid data validation
- Permission checks
- Invalid IDs and statuses

## Manual Testing with curl

You can also test individual endpoints manually:

```bash
# Set your token
export TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# Test endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3100/posts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/posts/create -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d '{"title":"Test","content":"Test content"}'
curl -X GET http://localhost:3100/posts/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/posts/1/upvote -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not running**: Make sure your server is running on port 3100
2. **Database connection**: Verify your database is connected and triggers are set up
3. **Authentication errors**: Check if JWT tokens are being generated correctly
4. **Trigger not working**: Verify the database triggers are properly installed

### Debug Mode

To see more detailed output, you can modify the test files to include more logging:

```javascript
// Add this to see detailed responses
console.log('Response:', JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 2));
```

### Database Verification

You can also verify the triggers are working by checking the database directly:

```sql
-- Check vote counts
SELECT id, title, upvotes, downvotes, answer_count, is_answered 
FROM posts 
WHERE id = [your_post_id];

-- Check post_votes table
SELECT * FROM post_votes WHERE post_id = [your_post_id];

-- Check comments
SELECT id, content, upvotes, downvotes, is_accepted 
FROM comments 
WHERE post_id = [your_post_id];
```

## Expected Behavior

- **Vote counts should update automatically** when votes are added/removed
- **Answer count should increment** when comments are added
- **View count should increment** each time a post is viewed
- **Accepted answers should appear first** in comment lists
- **All operations should be atomic** and consistent

If any of these behaviors are not working, check your database triggers and ensure they're properly installed and functioning.
